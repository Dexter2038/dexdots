# This is NOT a script for execution, but for loading functions, so NOT need execution permission or shebang.
# NOTE that you NOT need to `cd ..' because the `$0' is NOT this file, but the script file which will source this file.

# The script that use this file should have two lines on its top as follows:
# cd "$(dirname "$0")"
# export base="$(pwd)"
